# Phase 04 - Refinement

## Phase IV Objectives

* For the last 25 minutes, your goals should be to:

  * Complete any remaining functionality in your calculator

  * Handle bugs and edge cases (Example: What if a user tries to type in more numbers after getting the result? Will that mess up the screen?)

  * Create code to "restart" the calculator after a user hits "clear".
