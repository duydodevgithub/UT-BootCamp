## Instructions

* Replace your React application's `src` folder with [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src). If necessary, restart the dev server with the command `yarn start`.

* Open `src/components/JSXVariables.js` and notice the values being requested inside of the component:

  * Your name

  * The number of letters in your name

  * What you think about React

* Render each value inside of JSX curly braces. You will need to create JavaScript variables in order to accomplish this.

## Bonus

* Add another heading that says "My name without any vowels is: <insert name without vowels here>". Create a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns the string with the vowels removed. Run this function inside of JSX curly braces to complete the statement.
